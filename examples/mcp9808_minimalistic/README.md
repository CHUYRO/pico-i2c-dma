# mcp9808_minimalistic

A minimalistic example that continuously reads the temperature from an MCP9808
temperature sensor and prints the temperature. Unlike other examples, this
example doesn't do any error checking to keep the code as short as possible.

The MCP9808 is assumed to be at address 0x18 on I2C0 (GP4 and GP5).
